# Email-HTML-Analyzer

Analyzes emails in MIME formatby extracting content data like sender information, content-type, encodings used, and media queries.
This is a node.js app that can either run from the command line or in a web browser.  I used the npm module browserify to easily handle the require() methods used for node functionality, creating the file bundle.js which is the script for the html.

BEFORE USE:
  run npm install to download all necessary npm modules (will not work otherwise)
